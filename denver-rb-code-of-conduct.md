# Denver.rb Code of Conduct

Denver.rb aims to be a meetup that is welcoming for everyone.
A meetup that embraces learning and achievement for all, irregardless of
sex, gender identity or expression, race, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, age, body size, nationality, religious beliefs, or experience level.
We are a conglomeration of all of the above, and we expect everyone, from all
groups, to treat all others equally.

The rules we live by are simple and short:

* Be kind to others - do not insult or put down other attendees.
* Be professional - if you wouldn't do it at work, don't do it here.
* Be yourself - we expect and welcome differences.

That said, these things are not always so simple. Be careful in the words that
you choose. Remember that jokes can be offensive to those around you. Remember
that your sense of humor may not be the same as others.

## TL; DR

Be as welcoming as possible. Embrace newcomers. Ask questions. Learn.

Don't be crude, rude or otherwise crass.

## The business

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

We expect all attendees to behave in a manner consistent with the above.
Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meetup
at the sole discretion of the meetup organizers. If you are being harassed,
notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
please contact an organizer immediately.
